# Yelp
The capstone project used Yelp data to assess restaurant reviews and ratings. Over 5 million restaurant, retail, and service evaluations were in the dataset.  The initial phase in the project was to clean and preprocess the data, eliminating any missing or extraneous information and structuring it for analysis.  The study then employed data visualisation to find patterns and trends. Bar graphs, scatter plots, and heat maps were used to investigate rating distribution, the link between rating and number of reviews, and review keyword frequency.  The research then employed natural language processing and sentiment analysis to identify reviews as good, neutral, or negative and understand customer attitude toward different firms. This helped us understand why firms were highly regarded and where they might improve.  Finally, clustering and dimensionality reduction were employed in unsupervised learning to classify firms and compare them. This identified outliers and companies with comparable reviews and ratings. Using the Yelp dataset, this capstone project revealed consumer behaviour and preferences and helped companies improve performance and attract more customers.
